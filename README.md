# Theory vs. Practice

- List 3 reasons why asymptotic analysis may be misleading with respect to
  actual performance in practice.

- Suppose finding a particular element in a binary search tree with 1,000
  elements takes 5 seconds. Given what you know about the asymptotic complexity
  of search in a binary search tree, how long would you guess finding the same
  element in a search tree with 10,000 elements takes? Explain your reasoning.

- You measure the time with 10,000 elements and it takes 100 seconds! List 3
  reasons why this could be the case, given that reasoning with the asymptotic
  complexity suggests a different time.

## Plagarism Statement

All exercises must contain the following statement:
“I certify that I have listed all sources used to complete this exercise, including the use
of any Large Language Models. All of the work is my own, except where stated
otherwise. I am aware that plagiarism carries severe penalties and that if plagiarism is
suspected, charges may be filed against me without prior notice.”

## Note
I am attempting this from scratch, however I believe that I do remember our logic from last semester on the occasions when it came up after class after lecture.
Please forgive me if it isn't as verbose as my last answer as I am trying to be more concise with this excercise in particular.
Finally I will also check my new answers against my old answers after I complete them.

2) This problem works more like a standard math problem where we know what equation is used, the answer to the equation, and are only missing one constant. 
We set this up using the what we know is the average case for a binary search tree $\Theta(log_n)$, creating a system of equation using the number of elements and the completion time which wwill look like:
$constant * log_n(1000$ elements $)=5$ seconds
